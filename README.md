# Db Nyc

## Description

Db NYC is a visualization of the noise pollution in New York City. The app maps the location of 311 noise complaints, emergency services, social check-ins, and social venue reviews to create a dynamic heat-map of noise in the city broken down over a 24 hour period. 

Data was sourced from the NYC Open Data program, Google Places API, Foursquare API, and the Yelp API.
